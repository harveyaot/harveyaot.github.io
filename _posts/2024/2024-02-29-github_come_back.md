每次回看过去写的日记，经过时间的发酵，会更有感慨，要么感叹于内心的纯碎，有预见性，从来没有讨厌厌恶的时候，这就是日记写下去的好处。

Github 账号失而复得，让我非常的开心！再次验证了只要把事情按照规划一点点的做好，是非常有力量的。这里很像引用一下之前的信件，我觉得写的也很好,值得记录，就附整个信的末尾吧。

另外昨天，同事补了很多不了解的工作上的细节，验证我之前的想法，谨慎的推理可能是没有错的

最近为了买房子的事情，很是伤脑筋，怎么说呢，考虑好就行，应该怎么选都不是太大问题！

工作上，写了一些东西，感觉是在吃之前的积累的红利，没有新的思考和总结，也没有新的积累。要先把这个问题解决掉！

> Dear Clint:
> Thank you for your response. I understand that my GitHub account, harveyaot, was suspended due to a fraudulent payment.
> I'd like to explain the situation. In November 2023, I left Microsoft and lost access to my GitHub Copilot employee benefits. I tried to pay for Copilot using my Chinese credit card, but it didn't work. I urgently needed Copilot, so I contacted an agent on Alibaba who could help me pay for it. I paid 65 yuan (about $10) for 1 month (The attached photo is a screenshot of a transaction on Alibaba) and gave the agent my GitHub username and password so they could bind their credit card.
> I was busy with work and didn't think about it again until I found out my GitHub account was suspended.
> After receiving your email, I contacted the agent, but they had delisted their product and deactivated their account. I can't contact them or the credit card provider.
> I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. I implore GitHub to delete my account's payment information and restore access to my account. I am willing to compensate for any losses incurred, as this account is my priceless treasure.
> Copilot is a great product and I would like to continue using it. I would be happy to purchase a subscription through the official channels.
> I hope you can understand my situation and forgive me for my mistake.
